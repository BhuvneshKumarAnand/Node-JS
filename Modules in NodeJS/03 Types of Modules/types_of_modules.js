/* 
In Node.js, modules are a fundamental concept that allows you to organize and structure your code into reusable and maintainable components. There are different types of modules in Node.js:

1. Core Modules:

Core modules are built-in modules that come with the Node.js installation.
Examples include modules like fs (file system), http (HTTP server), path (path manipulation), and util (utilities).
You can use core modules by requiring them in your code.
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');


2. Local Modules:

Local modules are modules created by you or other developers in your project.
These modules are created to organize and encapsulate functionality into separate files.
You can create local modules by defining functions, objects, or classes in separate files and then exporting them for use in other files.
javascript
Copy code
// mathModule.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

module.exports = { add, subtract };
javascript
Copy code
// main.js
const mathModule = require('./mathModule');
console.log(mathModule.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8


3. Third-Party Modules:

Third-party modules are created by the Node.js community or other developers and are available through the npm (Node Package Manager) registry.
You can use third-party modules by installing them using the npm install command and then requiring them in your code.
bash
Copy code
npm install lodash
javascript
Copy code
const _ = require('lodash');


4. ES6 Modules (ECMAScript Modules):

Node.js introduced support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM) starting from version 13.2.0.
ES6 modules use the import and export syntax.
To use ES6 modules, you need to use the .mjs extension or set the "type": "module" field in your package.json file.
javascript
Copy code
// mathModule.mjs
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
javascript
Copy code
// main.mjs
import { add } from './mathModule.mjs';
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
These different types of modules in Node.js provide flexibility and allow you to organize and reuse code effectively in your applications.
