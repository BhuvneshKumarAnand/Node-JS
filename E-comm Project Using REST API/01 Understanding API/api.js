// API- Application Programming Interface

// Why not use MVC?
// due to tight coupling
// complexity of the application grows
// difficult to make changes
// difficult to scale

// API provides Loose coupling

// Types of API

// 1. Simple Object Access Protocol {SOAP} API's - Oldest API
// 2. REST:API (Lightweight, fast, Easy to work with)
// 3. GraphQL (Latest at least for now)
